# SMS-SPAM-DETECTION
SMS Spam Detection classifies text messages as spam (unwanted/promotional) or ham (legitimate). It uses machine learning with preprocessing (cleaning, tokenizing), feature extraction (e.g., TF-IDF), and classifiers like Naive Bayes or SVM. The system aims to filter spam effectively, enhancing user communication and security.
